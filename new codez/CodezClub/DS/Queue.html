<hr />

<em><strong>Data Structure Solved programs ----&gt;</strong></em>  C is a powerful general-purpose programming language. It is fast, portable and available in all platforms. If you are new to programming, C is a good choice to start your programming journey.

This page contains the Data Structure solved programs/examples with solutions, here we are providing most important programs on <em><strong>each topic</strong></em>. These Data Structure examples cover a wide range of programming areas in Computer Science.

Every example program includes the description of the program, Data Structure code as well as output of the program. All examples are compiled and tested on a Windows system.

These examples can be as simple and basic as “Hello World” program to extremely tough and advanced Data Structure programs. Here is the List of Data Structure solved programs/examples with solutions (category wise) and detailed explanation.
